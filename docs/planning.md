# Draft Plan (of sorts) for G

Extremely rought draft, but a basic high level planning document for the
different parts og G.

Doesn't need to stay this way, but can be edited/changed, be a living document,
but a single coherent plan that can be referred back to.

## Content

### Schemas

#### Node

Title of Node
Type of Node
Additional Metadata *User/Type dependent*

#### Universe

> Universe is a global commons database containing the base units we can all link
> to in all of our work.

### Associations/Metadata

#### Category Tree/Metaverse

> We can give users the ability to create category trees to map all possible
> categories for each of the five entity types and every relationship between
> them to allow for diverse use cases.

#### Constellations

Collaborative Space for one or more editor to create relationships between
node.

#### Galaxies

> Galaxies are a space where constellations can be combined and filtered to
> create a data collection tailored for a specific purpose.

#### Trust Networks

> A network of people whose knowledge and judgment we rely on to help us filter
> our data or to grant editing permissions. A filter of zero degrees of trust
> contains only items we ourselves explicitly trusted, one degree also contains
> anything trusted by those we trust, and so on. Four or five degrees of trust
> should bring all results that are not spam or astroturfing.
